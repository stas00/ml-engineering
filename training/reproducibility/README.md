# Reproducibility

## Achieve determinism in randomness based software

When debugging always set a fixed seed for all the used Random Number Generators (RNG) so that you get the same data / code path on each re-run.

Though with so many different systems it can be tricky to cover them all. Here is an attempt to cover a few:

```
import random, torch, numpy as np
def enforce_reproducibility(use_seed=None):
    seed = use_seed if use_seed is not None else random.randint(1, 1000000)
    print(f"Using seed: {seed}")

    random.seed(seed)    # python RNG
    np.random.seed(seed) # numpy RNG

    # pytorch RNGs
    torch.manual_seed(seed)          # cpu + cuda
    torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(seed) # multi-gpu - can be called without gpus
    if use_seed: # slower speed! https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/randomness.html#cuda-convolution-benchmarking
        torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True
        torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark     = False

    return seed
```
a few possible others if you use those subsystems/frameworks instead:
```
    torch.npu.manual_seed_all(seed)
    torch.xpu.manual_seed_all(seed)
    tf.random.set_seed(seed)
```

When you rerun the same code again and again to solve some problem set a specific seed at the beginning of your code with:
```
enforce_reproducibility(42)
```
But as it mentions above this is for debug only since it activates various torch flags that help with determinism but can slow things down so you don't want this in production.

However, you can call this instead to use in production:
```
enforce_reproducibility()
```
i.e. w/o the explicit seed. And then it'll pick a random seed and log it! So if something happens in production you can now reproduce the same RNGs the issue was observed in. And no performance penalty this time, as the `torch.backends.cudnn` flags are only set if you provided the seed explicitly. Say it logged:
```
Using seed: 1234
```
you then just need to change the code to:
```
enforce_reproducibility(1234)
```
and you will get the same RNGs setup.

As mentioned in the first paragraphs there could be many other RNGs involved in a system, for example, if you want the data to be fed in the same order for a `DataLoader` you need [to have its seed set as well](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/randomness.html#dataloader).

## Reproduce the software and system environment

This methodology is useful when discovering some discrepancy in outcomes - quality or a throughput for example.

The idea is to log the key components of the environment used to launch a training (or inference) so that if at a later stage it needs to be reproduced exactly as it was it can be done.

Since there is a huge variety of systems and components being used it's impossible to prescribe a way that will always work. So let's discuss one possible recipe and you can then adapt it to your particular environment.

This is added to your slurm launcher script (or whatever other way you use to launch the training) - this is Bash script:

```bash
SAVE_DIR=/tmp # edit to a real persistent path
export REPRO_DIR=$SAVE_DIR/repro/$SLURM_JOB_ID
mkdir -p $REPRO_DIR
# 1. modules (writes to stderr) (remove if you don't use lmod or similar modules implementation)
module list 2> $REPRO_DIR/modules.txt
# 2. shell env vars
/usr/bin/printenv | sort > $REPRO_DIR/env.txt
# 3. pip (this includes devel installs SHA)
pip freeze > $REPRO_DIR/requirements.txt
# 4. uncommitted diff in git clones installed into conda
perl -nle 'm|"file://(.*?/([^/]+))"| && qx[cd $1; if [ ! -z "\$(git diff)" ]; then git diff > \$REPRO_DIR/$2.diff; fi]' $CONDA_PREFIX/lib/python*/site-packages/*.dist-info/direct_url.json
```

As you can see this recipe is used in a SLURM environment, so every new training will dump the environment specific to the SLURM job. But you can adapt it to any other environment.

Let's expend on each step in the recipe:

1. We save which `modules` were loaded, e.g. in cloud cluster/HPC setups you're like to be loading the CUDA and cuDNN libraries using this.

   If you don't use `modules` then remove that entry

2. We dump the shell environment variables. This can be crucial since a single env var like `LD_PRELOAD` or `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` could make a huge impact on performance in some environments

3. We then dump the python environment packages and their versions - this should work with any virtual python environment like `conda`, `venv` or even if you don't use a virtual environment.

   If you use `uv` instead of `pip`, switch to `uv pip freeze` as it'd be much faster.

4. If you use a devel install with `pip install -e .` it doesn't know anything about the git clone repository it was installed from other than its git SHA. But the issue is that it's likely that you have modified the files locally and now `pip freeze` will miss those changes. So this part will go through all packages that are not installed into the conda environment (we find them by looking inside `site-packages/*.dist-info/direct_url.json`)

To save the `apt` packages add:
```
apt list --installed > $REPRO_DIR/apt-packages.txt
```

If using `conda` an additionally useful tool is [conda-env-compare.pl](https://github.com/stas00/conda-tools/blob/master/conda-env-compare.md) which helps you to find out the exact differences 2 conda environments have.

Anecdotally, me and my colleague were getting very different training TFLOPs on a cloud cluster running the exact same code - literally launching the same slurm script from the same shared directory. We first compared our conda environments using [conda-env-compare.pl](https://github.com/stas00/conda-tools/blob/master/conda-env-compare.md) and found some differences - I installed the exact packages she had to match her environment and it was still showing a huge performance difference. We then compared the output of `printenv` and discovered that I had `LD_PRELOAD` set up whereas she didn't - and that made a huge difference since this particular cloud provider required multiple env vars to be set to custom paths to get the most of their hardware.
