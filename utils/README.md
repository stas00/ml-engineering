# utils

Various useful utils around the system. Most are written by me unless stated otherwise.

- [feeder](./feeder) - feed one argument at a time to a program that accepts only a single argument
- [makegdocs](./makegdocs) - convert a folder of scanned images into a sequence of pdfs, under 11MB each - so that these can be uploaded to google drive and subsequently auto-OCRed by google docs.
- [makepdf](./makepdf) - convert a folder of scanned images into a pdf file
- [rename.pl](./rename.pl) - rename dir/file names using perl regex as an argument - a very old but still extremely useful program written by Larry Wall in 1990! You definitely want to have this one in your `$PATH` directory.
